👋 Hello, I'm Hardik Lakhalani.

👨‍💻 I'm a passionate learner focusing on app development using Flutter. My main areas of interest lie in leveraging Flutter's powerful framework to build robust and engaging mobile applications.

🌱 Currently, I'm dedicated to honing my skills in Flutter, Dart, and the VS Code IDE. I consistently seek out opportunities to enhance my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.

💼 I'm open to collaborating on basic Flutter app projects for practice and skill development. If you have a well-designed UI created with Figma, XD, AI, or PSD, I would love to connect and work together.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in collaborating or discussing any Flutter-related projects.
